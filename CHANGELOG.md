# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Bear in mind that the [GIT version](https://github.com/mental05/node-red-contrib-tplink-iot) *(source-code)* is always bleeding edge and may *(in most cases, will)* have changes that won't reflect in NPM/[release](https://github.com/mental05/node-red-contrib-tplink-iot/releases) version.

## 0.1.8 - Unreleased

### Added

- This file.
- Get most common info with **`getQuickInfo`** - *such as cloud account, power state, power consumption,  schedule, and many more*.
- **Filetree** hardcoded in `package.json` *(GIT builds clean now)*.
- Google **compiled code** in main `.js` files and formatted code in `.bak.js` files *- harder, better, faster, stronger*.

### Changed

- Fixed some typos *( @rajamalw )*.
- Commands sanity for `brightness` and `temperature` *- won't trigger unless device supports it ( @rajamalw )*.
- Updated documentation.

### Removed

Nothing but bad vibes.
